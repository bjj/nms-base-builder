:: INSTALLATION STEPS::
1. Download the latest release. (https://github.com/charliebanks/nms-base-builder/releases)
2. Open "User Preferences" in Blender.
3. Go to the Add-ons tab.
4. Click "Install Add-on from File..." at the bottom of the window.
5. Select the downloaded zip file.

:: Presets
Presets are stored in your "C:\Users\USERNAME\NoMansSkyBaseBuilder\presets" (or equivalent) directory.
These can be downloaded and shared with other people. You can find a few basic presets I've made on the nexus
mod page - https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/984?tab=files.

:: Mod Compatibility
The tool is designed towards supporting the vanilla game as much as possible, however
any additional base parts introduced by mods will display as cubes but will still be able to import/export to the game.

You can introduce your own OBJ's by adding them to your user directory folder. The layout for this should be...

* %USERPROFILE%\NoMansSkyBaseBuilder\
*** mods
***** mod_name
******* models
********* category
*********** MOD_WALLA.obj
*********** MOD_WALLB.obj
********* category_b
*********** MOD_FLOORA.obj
*********** MOD_FLOORB.obj

The names of categories is up to the user.

The obj file name should reflect the name of the part in-game.
