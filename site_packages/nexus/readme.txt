:: INSTALLATION STEPS::
1. Download the latest release. (https://github.com/charliebanks/nms-base-builder/releases)
2. Open "User Preferences" in Blender.
3. Go to the Add-ons tab.
4. Click "Install Add-on from File..." at the bottom of the window.
5. Select the downloaded zip file.

:: Presets
Presets are stored in your "C:\Users\USERNAME\NoMansSkyBaseBuilder\presets" (or equivalent) directory.
These can be downloaded and shared with other people. You can find a few basic presets I've made on the nexus
mod page - https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/984?tab=files.

:: Mod Compatibility
At this time the tool is designed only to work well with the vanilla game.
Mods that implement additional base items are supported but will only display as basic cubes.
All other functionality should still work including the import and export to the game.
